# What is mps-autonomy?

[`mps-autonomy`](https://github.com/florence-nocca/mps-autonomy) is an online companion to my ongoing PhD thesis in political science. This project seeks to estimate party cohesion through Members of Parliament's Twitter activity in five Western democracies (Canada, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Spain) using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.
